## Official definition

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for **automating deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of containerized applications

For highly understanding what k8s is. **It's a tool to orchestrate your containers.**

## Notice: When you do not need k8s

- When your application is **NOT** containerized. It's too early to consider using k8s. Make your application architecture to fit [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) and can help you to develop modern software.

- K8s is **NOT** a tool for small containerized application deployment. It will be over killed by using k8s and bring too much extra effort to the developer.

- When the team member does **NOT** understanding what k8s is and how it works, do not use it. Because k8s is **NOT** out of box. It's just a tool with huge mount of features and need the team to chose the desired part to use.

## What does kubernetes offer

Kubernetes can cover the most common use cases when we talking about performance, distributed system, micro-service architecture, etc.

**The main concept for using kubernetes is to declare the desired state of your application and kubernetes will help you to achieve it in distributed environment.**

Here is the main part of kubernetes feature I think:

- Service discovery and load balance
- Automatic roll outs and roll backs
  - Blue/Green deployment
  - Canary release
  - Rolling deployment
- Self healing and scaling
