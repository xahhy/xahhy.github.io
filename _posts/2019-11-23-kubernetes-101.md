## Official definition

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for **automating deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of containerized applications

For highly understanding what k8s is. **It's a tool to orchestrate your containers.**

## Notice: When you do not need k8s

When your application is **NOT** containerized. It's too early to consider using k8s. Make your application architecture to fit [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) and can help you to develop modern software.

K8s is **NOT** a tool for small containerized application deployment. It will be over killed by using k8s and bring too much extra effort to the developer.
